Unified instruction/data cache

My architecture is set up according to 2-way set associative Unified instruction/data cache structure. It has write_back and LFU algorithms and it manages data effectively with these algorithms. 
I develop it for a RISC-V core with Verilog
It needs some updates but its open to development
